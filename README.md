# Treehouse Webapp Dashboard - Hongsoon Kim
<p>The purpose of this project is to create a game called "Wheel of Success" where users need to guess a random phrase by clicking on the onscreen keyboard. The user needs to correctly guess all of the letters to win the game. The user is allowed five misses before losing the game. Regardless of the outcome, the user is notified of the correct phrase.  I utilized JavaScript, functions, event listeners, and CSS transitions to complete the project.</p>
